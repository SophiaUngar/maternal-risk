# Ordinal Classification With Neural Net

## Purpose

Ordinal Classification is harder to do with a neural network,
and I wanted to learn how. I have tried to keep this code flexible
so that it will work well with any ordinal data.

## Data

The data I am using as an example contains information about a 
pregnant person and their risk level (high, medium, or low). It can 
be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/maternal-health-risk-data).
